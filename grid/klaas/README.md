These are the SVG files as used to cut the parts for the table out of 3mm MDF, at my local Fablab.
Since the maximum dimensions in the lasercutter are 300x600mm, the parts have been divided as such over the files.

Parts A and B are the interlocking panels that create the inner "cubes". Parts C and D are the sides of the table.
The bottomplate has been designed for use with presoldered strings of WS2812 SMD LED pixels. They fit into the holes and then need to be glued in place. It's not a perfect fit so you may want to modify the svg's according to your build's requirements.
